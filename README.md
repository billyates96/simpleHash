# simpleHash
I had to make another branch because I did not want to use the one I created in class, and also I could not push to master because I had created an entirely new project that did not match up with the master branch, and Git kept rejecting the push. This is the last branch I will make and won't make the same mistake again.

In this version, I have reworked the code to be completely object oriented, compared to the last one which was simply functional.
In line comments explain step by step the program function and what is happening within the compiler. Refer to main.cpp for answers on functionality.
